"""The S18 docpage: what the asset resync changed, and what it cost to find out.

Same contract as the other page generators here -- every number comes out of the
run directory, so the page cannot drift from the measurement without the file
changing under it. Unlike them the body is inline: this page is meant to be
short, and a two-file split for six sections is more machinery than content.

It DEGRADES. The grid's stress stage takes about an hour; sections whose inputs
are not there yet say so and the page still builds, because a page you cannot
regenerate mid-run is a page nobody regenerates.

<li><b>Merged <code>icra2026</code></b> for asset and environment parity: table
at 1.04&nbsp;m, legs to the floor, Allen's real-run brace keyframes, the deploy
helpers and the base estimator. The MPC method is <i>not</i> synced.</li>
<li><b>The actuator torque budget moved into the generator.</b> icra2026 shipped
it as a patch hunk quoting the ctrlranges the CL_Assets import rewrites, so the
hunk rejected &mdash; and the magpie patch runs through a tolerant wrapper that
discards the <code>.rej</code>. The build reported success while shipping a model
with no <code>forcerange</code> at all.</li>
<li><b>The gripper is generated from CL_Assets</b>, welded: no joint, no body,

the generator re-loads the task model and refuses to write otherwise. All eight
parts land within 0.0004&nbsp;mm of the CAD.</li>

<h2>4 &middot; Where this leaves the deploy</h2>
<p>The controller was always deployment-shaped and it was hard to see: the replay
computed <code>(q_des, kp, kd, tau_ff)</code> &mdash; exactly what
<code>rt/lowcmd</code> carries &mdash; and then collapsed it into MuJoCo's single
<code>ctrl</code> on the last line before stepping. That collapse,
<code>ctrl = q_des + (tau_ff + kd&nbsp;v_des)/kp</code>, is a property of the
MuJoCo <i>plant</i>, not of the controller.</p>
<p>So the port is a plant swap, and <code>croco/plant/</code> is the whole of it:
<code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, <code>now()</code>. None of
<code>deploy_common.cc</code>'s 2683 lines are needed, because this stack never
links <code>libmjpc</code> &mdash; it reads one MJCF and plans in Pinocchio.
Verified against the staged model: the inversion reproduces
<code>kp&thinsp;e + kd&thinsp;e&#775; + tau_ff</code> to 1.2e-14, and the MJCF
actuator order <i>is</i> the Unitree motor order.</p>

<h2>5 &middot; Three things that cost a bisect</h2>
<p>The re-run failed with SIGSEGV in every contact mode before it produced a
number, and none of the causes was the assets. They are recorded because each
one presented as something else:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>build/</code> is root-owned under docker, so the staging script could
not write. Now <code>STAGE_ROOT</code>.</li>
<li>The bridge defaulted its URDF to the cmake FetchContent tree, so a machine
that staged with <code>CL_ASSETS_DIR</code> got a staged MJCF and no URDF, and
failed inside urdfdom as <i>&ldquo;does not contain a valid URDF model&rdquo;</i>
&mdash; a parse error for a file that is simply absent.</li>
<li><b>The interpreter.</b> <code>base</code> has a crocoddyl wheel set whose
<i>contact</i> dynamics segfault; the <code>croco</code> env's works. Every cell
died <code>rc=-11</code> with no traceback, on the old model as well as the new
one, which reads exactly like an asset regression. A contact-<i>free</i>
crocoddyl problem solves fine in the broken environment, so &ldquo;crocoddyl
works&rdquo; proves nothing. <code>croco_env.py</code> now probes it in a
subprocess &mdash; the failure is a signal, not an exception &mdash; and
<code>run_session.sh</code> runs that check before anything long starts.</li>
