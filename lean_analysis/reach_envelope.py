"""How far out can the robot reach, with and without a brace?

The contact-selection map answers "which contacts are cheapest HERE". It cannot
answer the question the paper actually rests on, which is whether the brace buys
REACH -- targets that are unreachable without it. This sweeps the target away
from the robot along x at fixed y,z and reports, per contact set, the last target
that is still statically holdable.

Two failure modes are distinguished, because they mean opposite things:
  unsolved    the IK could not put the brace sites on the table (a GEOMETRY
              limit -- the contact is not available at this target)
  infeasible  the pose exists but no admissible force distribution does (a
              STRENGTH limit -- the contact is available and not enough)
