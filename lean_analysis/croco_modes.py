"""Enumerate contact modes at one reach target and SAVE the pose for each.

sweep5_full.py already enumerates 2^5 contact subsets and scores them with the
static QP, but it keeps only the scalars -- the pose that earned the score is
thrown away when `load()` is called for the next subset.  crocoddyl needs the
pose: q* is the terminal target of the OCP and the contact subset is its contact
schedule, and they have to be the SAME solve or the plan is aiming at a pose that
was never certified.

So this is sweep5_full's inner loop with the qpos retained, written one file per
admissible mode, plus a manifest recording which solve produced which pose.

Admissibility is sweep5_full's, unchanged:
    IK ok (reach < 3 cm, feet pinned, no penetration, every site actually
    touching)  AND  base residual < 1 N  AND  max |tau|/tau_limit <= 1.
Ranking is sweep5_full's too: least normalized actuator effort, ties broken
toward FEWER contacts.

    NOT a body-identity test, and that is the correction.  `solve_ik`'s own
    `sites_placed` asks whether the SITE'S BODY is in the table's contact list,
    and for two of the three arm sites that body is the wrong one:

      palm     the site hangs off `left_magpie_gripper`, but the part of the hand
               assembly that reaches the wood first is the WRIST housing and its
               brace pad on `left_wrist_yaw_link`.  Measured over the sweep, a
               palm brace lands 31-44 mm from the palm site, on the parent link,
               every single time -- so a body test reports "palm: not touching"
               for a hand that is visibly flat on the table.
      elbow    the site is the elbow JOINT on the upper-arm link; the upper arm
               touches on its capsule surface, ~47 mm away (S11 measured this).

    So a site counts as placed when MuJoCo reports a table contact within
    `radius` of it, and each contact is assigned to its NEAREST site first, so a
    single contact cannot certify two sites at once -- which matters here because
    the elbow and forearm sites are only 57 mm apart.

    """Re-solve the IK against MuJoCo's REAL narrowphase, warm-started from P.

    WHY THIS IS NEEDED.  `contact_select.load()` inflates every geom's collision
    margin by IK_MARGIN = 25 mm so the IK can see a collision before it enters
    one, and `collision_rows` then drives every contact inside that band to
    dist = 0.  Those two together are supposed to snap a brace site onto the
    table -- but they are a soft term among several, and the compromise the step
    QP settles on routinely leaves the site a few millimetres clear.  MuJoCo at
    the inflated margin still calls that a contact, so `all_placed` is satisfied
    and the pose is certified.  MuJoCo at the REAL margin does not, and neither
    does the replay.

    Measured over the (mode x target) sweep before this existed: of 16 certified
    poses, 9 had at least one requested site with no real contact, and two -- both
    elbow+forearm+palm -- had none of the three touching.  Those are exactly the
    cells whose closed-loop replays collapsed with 0 N of brace force, which is
    the S12 "leaning on thin air" failure reappearing one stage upstream, in the
    certification rather than in the plan.

    The fix is not a new objective: it is the same IK on a model whose margin is
    ZERO, warm-started from the pose the first pass found.  The site z-rows keep
    pulling the site down; the collision rows now fire only on real contact and
    stop it at dist = 0.

    IT IS RUN IN SHORT CHUNKS AND STOPPED AT THE FIRST GOOD POSE, and that is not
    a performance tweak.  The site sits on the link AXIS, so "site z = table z"
    asks for the link half a diameter INSIDE the slab, and the collision rows are
    the only thing opposing it.  Pressed to convergence, the three-contact mode
    buries the forearm 15-17 mm in the wood and the single-elbow mode buries the
    upper arm 47 mm -- trading a missing contact for an inadmissible penetration.
    So the pose is scored BEFORE any pressing (one that already touches is left
    alone, which is why the S13 reference pose is unchanged by this) and after
    every 2-iteration chunk, on the criteria that actually matter: every site
    touching, nothing deeper than 10 mm.  The first pose that satisfies them wins;
    failing that the shallowest placed pose does; failing that the last iterate is
    returned and the caller's admissibility test rejects it.
