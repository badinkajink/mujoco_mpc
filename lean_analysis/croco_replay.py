"""Replay a crocoddyl plan in MuJoCo under five controllers, score it, render it.

crocoddyl solved the plan against RIGID, PRESCRIBED contacts on a Pinocchio
model.  MuJoCo has soft contacts, a real table it can collide with anywhere, and
position-servo actuators.  Whether the plan survives that is the only question
that matters, and it is not answerable from the solver's own cost.

THE LADDER.  S12 compared two things -- "position tracking" and "torque
inversion" -- found both failed, and concluded that "the missing piece is a
tracking controller".  Neither of those two closes a loop around the BASE, which
is the only loop that matters here, so this runs the whole ladder and lets "does
closing the loop help" be a measurement.  Every mode below sends the command the
real robot takes, (q_des, kp, kd, tau_ff); they differ only in tau_ff and q_des:

  kinematic    no dynamics; drive MuJoCo onto q_plan.  What crocoddyl BELIEVES
               it planned.  Contact forces here are meaningless by construction.
  hold         q_des = the START pose, forever.  The control experiment: it says
               how long this robot stays up doing NOTHING, which turns out to be
               the number every other row has to be read against.
  position     q_des = q_plan, tau_ff = 0.  The servo is the whole controller --
               a naive WBC handoff, with no knowledge of the planned torques.
  ff           q_des = q_plan, tau_ff = tau_plan.  The deployment-faithful
               handoff, and what S12 called "torque inversion" -- note it is NOT
               open-loop torque: the servo's PD term is still underneath it.
               (`torque` is kept as an alias for S12's name.)
  torque_meas  invert the servo at the MEASURED state, which cancels it exactly
               and leaves pure open-loop tau_plan.  The ablation that says how
               much of a replay's survival is the plan and how much is the servo.
  riccati      tau_ff = tau_plan - K_k (x_meas (-) x_plan).  The gains are the
               DDP's OWN Riccati gains, computed on the way to its step and
               otherwise thrown away: a time-varying LQR about the optimal
               trajectory, for free, and the first row that feeds back the base.
  mpc          re-solve a short-horizon OCP from the measured state every control
               step, warm-started from the last solution; apply its first control
               AND its first predicted state as the servo's setpoint.  Refinement
               and stabilisation together.

TWO THINGS THIS GETS RIGHT, both of which have burned this study before:

 1. THE ACTUATORS ARE POSITION SERVOS, not torque sources: tau = kp (ctrl - q)
    - kd qvel, with kp/kd read off the model rather than assumed.  Writing the
    plan's torques into d.ctrl commands a joint angle of a few hundred radians.
 2. THE PLAN IS AT dt = 0.02 AND MuJoCo RUNS AT 0.002.  Each plan node is held
    for the intervening substeps rather than one MuJoCo step per node, which
    would replay a 2 s trajectory in 0.2 s and call the resulting flailing a
    tracking failure.

    The horizon slides over the SAME action models the plan was built from, so
    every cost the MPC sees -- landing spots, the reach target, the cones, the
    keep-out -- is the one the plan was solved against.  Nothing is re-authored
    for the online problem, which is the point: this measures what re-solving
    from the measured state buys, not what a different cost function buys.

    `iters` is small on purpose.  A warm-started DDP that takes one or two
    iterations per control step is the standard MPC construction (the previous
    solution is a very good guess when the state has moved 20 ms), and it is what
    makes the per-step solve time reportable rather than embarrassing.
    """

    COARSE = """A COARSER MPC GRID, and why it is decimation and not a
    non-uniform horizon.

    The obvious structural saving is a fine head at the control period and a
    coarse tail at a multiple of it: a 1 s preview in 30 nodes instead of 50.
    It is not implementable cheaply here, and the reason is the window
    management rather than the models.  crocoddyl gives exactly one cheap
    sliding operation, `circularAppend`, measured at 4.4 us -- and it ROTATES
    the whole list, which is only correct if every node is the same duration.
    A mixed fine/coarse window has to be re-pointed with `updateModel`, measured
    at 263 us per node because it re-creates that node's data (`createData`
    alone is 98 us).  Re-pointing a 15-node coarse tail every control period is
    3.9 ms against a ~10 ms step: the window management costs more than the
    fifteen nodes it removes.

    What IS cheap is a UNIFORM grid at n times the control period, because
    rotation stays valid -- the window simply advances one coarse node every n
    control periods instead of one fine node every period.  The controller
    still runs at the control period and still re-solves from the measured
    state every time; what changes is that its grid shifts on a coarser clock.
    So `dt_scale` decimates: model i of the coarse list is the plan's node i
    integrated for n*dt, and the window covers plan nodes anchored n apart.
    Same preview, n times fewer nodes, one `circularAppend` per n periods."""
