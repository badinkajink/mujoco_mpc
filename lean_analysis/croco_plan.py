"""crocoddyl MVP: plan stand -> braced contact mode for the H1-2 lean.

WHAT THIS IS FOR.  Today the braced lean is authored by hand: eight keyframes, a
14 s weight ramp, and a 10-sample Cross-Entropy MPC with a 1 s horizon tracking
the setpoint they drag past it.  The keyframes ARE the plan; CEM is a
short-horizon stabilizer.  The offline study separately certifies a pose q* and a
contact subset by enumeration + a static-equilibrium LP/QP, and the hand-authored
ramp lands ~1.5 rad away from it.  This closes that gap the other way: take the
enumeration's (q*, contact schedule) and ask a DDP to produce the trajectory
that gets there, with the contact schedule PRESCRIBED -- which is the input
crocoddyl wants and the thing the enumeration already produces.

STRUCTURE.  Phases over a prescribed schedule:

    A  approach   feet only.        Lower the CoM and swing the bracing arm out
                                    over the table, everything kept OUT of the
                                    table box, CoM kept over the feet.
    I  impact     impulse at the    Zero-velocity touchdown of the bracing sites.
       brace sites                  (off by default -- see `build`)
    B  braced     feet + brace.     Settle onto q*, reach the target, come to
                                    rest inside the friction cones, with the
                                    brace sites HELD on their landing spots.
    R  return     feet only.        Optional: lift the brace off the table and
                                    come back to the start pose, CoM over feet
                                    again.  `n_return > 0`.

WHAT S12 GOT WRONG, AND WHAT CHANGED (2026-08-06).  The S12 plan solved and did
not survive MuJoCo.  A node-by-node geometry readout (`croco_diag.py`) says why,
and it is not what the S12 write-up guessed:

  1. THE BRACED PHASE WAS LEANING ON THIN AIR.  Over all 41 braced nodes the
     elbow site sat 52.6 mm above the tabletop and the forearm site 19.0 mm above
     it, against 42.9 / 33.6 mm at the certified pose -- so the elbow was ~10 mm
     too high and the forearm ~15 mm too low, i.e. one link hovering and the
     other buried.  The contact models were happily supplying force at both.
     Nothing in the OCP made the landing accurate: the `land_` cost ramped to a
     weight of 50 against a reach cost of 100 and a terminal state cost, and
     ContactModel3D with Baumgarte Kp = 0 constrains velocity, not position, so
     once the phase starts the site stays wherever it arrived.  FIX: the landing
     cost is z-weighted and much heavier, and the braced phase carries an
     explicit `hold_` cost at the landing spot.
  2. THE HALF-SPACE BARRIER COULD NOT EXPRESS THE TABLE.  See croco_geom: the
     tabletop is a box, the certified pose hangs geometry over its edge, and
     `z >= table_z` cannot say "below the top but outside the footprint".
     FIX: a box-SDF keep-out, thresholded so the certified pose is feasible.
  3. THE GRIPPER WAS NOT A CONTACT BUT WAS TOUCHING.  At q*, MuJoCo's narrowphase
     reports the bracing gripper on the table (3 contacts, 0.9-3.7 mm deep)
     alongside the elbow and forearm links.  Planning `elbow+forearm` therefore
     left a body that is IN CONTACT in the certified pose completely
     unconstrained, which is how it ended up 68 mm through the slab.  FIX: run
     the mode that matches what the pose actually does -- `elbow+forearm+palm`.
  4. NOTHING KEPT THE CoM OVER THE FEET.  The approach leans out over the table
     on feet-only support for over a second, and rigid prescribed contacts let
     the optimiser borrow support it does not have yet.  FIX: a quadratic barrier
     holding the CoM inside the foot polygon (shrunk by a margin) whenever the
     brace is not down.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT MODELLED.  Honest list, because these are the costs that decide
whether the result transfers:

  * Contacts are RIGID and prescribed.  This is not MuJoCo's soft contact model,
    so predicted forces will not match MuJoCo's exactly -- `croco_replay.py`
    measures the difference rather than assuming it away.
  * The table is a contact reference and a keep-out box built from
    `table_top_collision`.  Its LEGS are not modelled; nothing in this maneuver
    goes near them (verified: min clearance over the plan is reported by
    croco_diag).
  * The feet are 6D-pinned at their placement in the START pose, not at q*'s.
    The study's IK pinned feet at the brace SEED keyframe, whose stance is 19 mm
    narrower than `stand`; a rigid contact cannot be in two places, so the start
    pose wins and q* enters as a posture target rather than a hard terminal
    constraint.  How far the result actually lands from q* is measured, not
    assumed -- see the report at the end of a run.
  * Torque limits are the study's `clamp` basis, enforced as hard box bounds by
    SolverBoxFDDP.

`legacy=True` restores the S12 formulation exactly (half-space barrier, no hold,
no CoM barrier, no return phase) and reproduces its numbers to 7 figures.
