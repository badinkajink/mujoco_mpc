"""Can MJPC ENTER, HOLD and LEAVE the braced pose the offline study certifies?

The previous handoff run (S11) asked only "does sampling find a brace", got no,
and read that as a cost-definition problem.  It was, but not the one it named.
Strategy 22 is EIGHT keyframes -- stand_up, forearm_brace_lean,
forearm_brace_reach, forearm_brace_release, standback_r1..r3, stand_up -- and
every one of them carries `success_sustain_time: 9999` and `time_limit: 9999`.
With the Phase parameter at its -1 default, lean.cc's auto-advance needs
`t - success_start > 9999` to fire.  It never fires.  A headless run therefore
spends its entire duration in keyframe 0, whose weight map sets Brace Pos, Brace
Force, Contact and Reaching Hand Dist to ZERO.  S11 measured the STAND cost and
reported it as the brace task's.

So the phase has to be driven externally (testspeed --phase_schedule), and then
three separate questions become askable, which is the point:

  hold    start ON the QP pose with the brace cost live.  Does it stay?
  enter   start standing, switch to the brace cost.  Does it get there, and does
          it pick the contacts the offline enumeration picked?
  return  from a held brace, walk the release/standback phases.  Does it recover
          a stand, and does it do so without a fall?
  chain   all three back to back, which is the deployable artefact.

`hold_p0` is the control: the same QP start with the STAND cost live, i.e. what
S11 actually ran.  If hold_p1 survives and hold_p0 does not, the S11 "MJPC
rejects the braced pose" result is explained by the phase, not by the planner.
