  // CURRENT pose and freeze the phase clocks every tick; the deploy node arms
  // it when full planner authority lands, so the glide runs WHILE the planner
  // rises. Default-armed => GUI / twin / every other flow byte-identical.
  // STAGGER (strat 27) Foot Stability anchor -- RE-PINNED EVERY TICK, on purpose.
  //
  // Unseeded, this term anchors to kRight/kLeftFootHomeXY, which share the same x = a SQUARE
  // stance, so it spent every run dragging the stagger square (live stagger_S collapsed
  // 0.157 -> 0.103 before the fall). Straighten's fix seeds ONCE and freezes at hand-over via
  // the deploy's `Funnel Arm`; that flag is wired to --straighten_start only, and stagger boots
  // through --align_start, so there is no hand-over signal to freeze on here.
  //
  // Re-pinning every tick is not a workaround, it is the better contract. Transition runs on the
  // TRUE state once per plan; Residual runs on ROLLOUT states over the horizon. So anchor ==
  // "where the feet are RIGHT NOW" makes the term read: do not PLAN to move the feet over the
  // next horizon. That is precisely the anti-slide this needs, and it is immune to BOTH failure
  // modes of a frozen anchor -- the square-stance bias AND the odometric drift that accumulates
  // into a phantom foot-drag over a 90 s run. It cannot correct creep that already happened; it
  // prevents creep from being planned, which is the thing we are actually fighting.
  //
  // (Foot Slip, weight 25, tries this on VELOCITY: at the observed ~2.8 mm/s creep it scores
  //  0.0028*25 = 0.07 cost units. Invisible. Position-over-horizon is the version with teeth.)
