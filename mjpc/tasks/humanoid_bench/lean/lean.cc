// rollout workers in Residual (benign double read; changes on a seconds
// timescale, same pattern as stabilize's s_cap_ex_dc).
//
// WHY THE STAND NEEDS IT (2026-07-20 real): with the IMU offset finally
// measured honest (pitch 0.0 / roll 1.3) the stand held 83 s with base_z
// sd 0.005 -- but still walked a slow FORWARD ramp (lean +0.2 deg at t=4 ->
// +6.8 deg at t=72) that loaded LankP to its 44.8 Nm useful cap (49.3% of
// ticks budget-clamped, 29.3 deg tracking error) until the left leg gave up.
// That residual bias is ankle-zero + CoM-model error: it is NOT constant
// (both 07-20 recordings show the solved ankle zeros drifting 4-8 deg WITHIN
// one 50 s run), so no XML constant can cancel it. A leaky integral does not
// need to know the bias -- it nulls whatever steady park it observes.
//
// Recipe (Stephens IROS'07 integral CoP/posture; Caron ICRA'19 leaky DCM
// integral) with the four v1 defects already fixed upstream: leak, support
// frame, nominal 0, quiet gate. See stand_trim_* in Lean_H12_Magpie.xml.

// brace cost gated on brace_contact_force (support-widening hand_load_frac, the P3
// CoM load transfer, the P4 reach gate, the brace-force shortfall reward) was
// therefore silently DEAD -- the controller could not feel its own brace.

// Reading the contacts directly is exact, pose-independent, and immune to which
// link happens to bite first, which is the whole point: the braced forearm+wrist is

  // NOT the physical face (z 0.865). Same frame confusion that killed the brace gate
  // (fixed 2026-07-25 by `brace_gate_fix`) — it was never fixed HERE. Consequence:
  //   brace_press_depth 0.06 -> ideal_brace.z 0.750 = 115 mm INSIDE the wood
  //   brace_press_depth 0.00 -> ideal_brace.z 0.810 =  55 mm INSIDE the wood
  // so the knob CANNOT express "press at the surface" — its whole range is below the
  // slab. That is why lowering it SATURATED (34 deg) instead of shallowing the bow, and
  // it means the 2026-07-27 refutation of `brace_press_depth` was a refutation of a
  // control that could not reach the value it needed.
  // At `Brace Pos` weight 120 this is a permanent, UN-NULLABLE downward demand: the pad
  // is stopped by the wood at the face, the residual never reaches zero, and the body
  // keeps bowing to chase it until the PELVIS lands on the slab. Measured (brace22_1,

  // pelvis 486 N MEDIAN and torso 406 N median, while the only ALLOWED contact, the
  // left forearm pad, carried 50 N. See [[feedback_audit_the_load_path_not_the_pose]].
  // With this ON the depth is measured from the FACE: 0.06 = 60 mm below the surface,

  // 1.6 cm wiggle against a 0.02 threshold), so the cost was STRUCTURALLY BLIND
  // to heel-lift -- and it could not tell heel-up from toe-up either. Same class
  // as the `foot_left_pos` framepos bug in the Balance polygon.
  //
  // Measured defect it exists to fix (bench20_ladder run02): the RIGHT heel is
  // off the floor from t~31 to t~47 -- the ENTIRE reach and brace hold -- and
  // BOTH heels lift at t=37-39, exactly at peak right-arm reach (728 mm). On
  // its forefeet the foot is free to rotate about the toe, so the ankle has NO
  // restoring authority at all, and the Balance hull is meanwhile crediting
  // heel area that is not in contact.
  //

  // -0.0000/-0.0008 at a plain stand); heel-up/toe-down => NEGATIVE (-0.084 L,
  // -0.172 R at t=38); toe-up/rocking-back => POSITIVE (+0.104 at t=70, which is

  // world-frame heading lottery" that "steered the calibrated real stand -22 ->
  // +7 deg and dragged the feet", and fixed it there; lean never got the port.
  // It mattered here because lean ships Body Yaw at weight ZERO in every phase,
  // so nothing has ever anchored the floating-root yaw: measured, the robot
  // twists 20 deg of yaw and 9 deg of roll in the 20 s AFTER the stand-up
  // begins (yaw +2.7 at t=60 -> -17.9 at t=80, worst run -31.6), which leaves
  // the two legs in different configurations -- the left ankle then sits 12 deg
  // off its target while the RIGHT ankle lands exactly, and that asymmetry IS
  // the residual bow that stops the robot standing back up square.
  // Enabling the cost as-is would import the lottery. Face the FEET'S OWN MEAN
  // HEADING instead: placement-invariant, no world anchor, the reference
  // FOLLOWS the stance rather than steering it -- same family as the
  // balance_frame and support-polygon fixes.
  // ⚠ MEASURED 2026-08-02: NEITHER of the two existing references works here.
  //  * FEET reference (the stabilize port): torso yaw ~= feet yaw to within
  //    1-8 deg, i.e. the WHOLE ROBOT PIVOTS ON THE FLOOR, feet included. The
  //    reference rotates WITH the failure, so the cost is blind by
  //    construction. Measured effect: yaw -11.7 -> -12.5 deg. Nothing.
  //    (It is still the right instrument for stabilize, whose failure is the
  //    torso twisting against PLANTED feet -- different disease.)
  //  * LEGACY world reference normalize(reach_target - torso) resolves to
  //    -18.2 deg here, because the reach target sits off to the robot's right.
  //    Anchoring to it would pull the stand FURTHER from square than the
  //    -12.5 deg it already drifts to.
  // What a stand-back actually wants is a FIXED heading: end facing where you
  // started. `body_yaw_ref_deg` supplies exactly that (default 0 = +x = the
  // spawn heading), and it is only ever weighted in the release/stand_up

  // ----- Body must NOT lean on the table (the ARM braces, not the torso) - //
  // User (2026-05-20): in the unbraced lean (mode 2) the robot was resting its
  // pelvis / lower-torso on the tabletop to hold the lean. That free support
  // is what suppressed the emergent counterbalance-arm posture — with the
  // table holding the body up, the planner had no reason to balance the reach
  // with the free arm (it counterbalanced contactlessly before, at this same
  // Posture weight). The pelvis/torso↔table collision excludes are
  // intentionally OFF so the body can't ghost through the edge (R12/test15),
  // but nothing penalised RESTING on it. Penalise the normal contact force
  // between the pelvis or torso and the table so the only thing allowed to
  // bear load on the table is the bracing arm/elbow — forcing a contactless,
  // CoM-balanced lean.
  //
  // GATED to `!any_arm_contact` for the retired hand/palm brace phases: those
  // deep poses brought the body low near the table and an always-on penalty
  // fought the brace establishing.
  // 2026-07-01: RE-ENABLED for the forearm_brace_lean (user: "the only load-
  // bearing places should be the forearm and the legs, nothing else" — the hip
  // must NOT rest on the table). At 0.87 m the forearm brace keeps the pelvis
  // ~x0.25 (well behind the 0.40 edge) so this penalises ONLY an actual pelvis/
  // torso-table graze (0 in the good pose) without fighting the forearm seat.
  //
  // ★★★★★ 2026-07-27: THE ALLOW-LIST ABOVE WAS THE BUG. Two independent holes, both
  // MEASURED with table_contact_ledger.py on plant traces:
  //   (1) It names only `pelvis` + `torso_link`. NOTHING watched the arms, hips or
  //       grippers. In a direct 6->22 brace the ENTIRE RIGHT ARM landed on the wood
  //       (right_forearm_pad 115 N median, right_shoulder_yaw 78 N, jaws, wrist pad)
  //       while the only ALLOWED contact, left_forearm_pad, carried 7.9 N.
  //   (2) The gate `(!any_arm_contact || is_forearm_brace)` DISABLES it whenever an
  //       arm is already touching and the phase is not the brace itself -- i.e. for
  //       ALL of the reach phases. So in a reach->brace ladder the
  //       robot lay down on the table FOR FREE during reach: pelvis 433-521 N, torso
  //       112-148 N, hip links, gripper -- on a 674 N robot, with the forearm at
  //       22-44 N. By the time the brace phase switches this penalty on (weight 150,
  //       ~62,700/step at 438 N) escaping would mean LIFTING 500 N, so it never does.
  // ⇒ Every brace/lean verdict from 2026-07-24..27 -- pad flatness 0.01 deg, 53%
  //   seating, "430 s no fall, drift -0.001", the "drape", CoM-past-toe, the failed
  //   recovery, and the null result from brace_force_target 50->100 -- was measured on

  // straight into the passive "strut" -- a positive feedback that the live trace
  // shows as roll +0.6 -> +3 deg with the right hip_roll torque 2.3x the left.
  // This term closes that gap: penalise the torso-subtree CoM's LATERAL (y)
  // offset from the foot midpoint (same CoM proxy + foot sensors Balance already
  // uses, all fetched above). Quadratic -> gradient 0 at centre, so it opposes a
  // SUSTAINED drift without fighting a legitimate transient lateral push-recovery

  // for the right, and it UNLOADS 56% median across the brace while the right
  // foot picks the load up. Unload predicts slide (Spearman rho +0.31, p=0.041;
  // the high-unload half slides 112 mm further, p=0.029). That is EXACTLY the
  // strut/buckle feedback this term was written to kill -- but the
  // `!any_arm_contact` gate switches it OFF the instant the forearm seats, i.e.
  // precisely when the brace starts pulling load off the ipsilateral leg. The
  // gate's original rationale (leg-lift / lean / retrieve legitimately stand
  // off-centre) still holds for those keyframes, which simply carry weight 0.
  // Fore-aft lean is untouched: this residual is the y axis only.

  // WRONG while a brace carries load. Measured on 20 braced frames: CoM y - mid
